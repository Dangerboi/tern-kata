# tern-kata

Browse and edit [kata](https://katatracker.com/) Issues in a native [Tern](https://docs.stencil.so/tern/) Pane.

kata ([source](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata)) is an issue tracker built for coding agents and the people steering them. Agents create, claim, relate and close Issues from its CLI, and people follow the same work in its terminal UI, `kata tui`. By default Issues live in a local SQLite database rather than in your repo, and no hosted service is needed. tern-kata shows that work in a Tern Pane drawn with Tern's own widgets instead of terminal text.

The same example Project in tern-kata (top) and in `kata tui` (bottom), both running in Tern:

![tern-kata showing the acme-shop Project with "Add Apple Pay to checkout" selected](docs/images/tern-kata.png)

![kata tui showing the same Project and Issue](docs/images/kata-tui.png)

In tern-kata, Issue bodies render as Markdown, priorities and labels show as chips, and rows, tabs and links respond to mouse clicks.

## How it works

The plugin has two halves:

- **`tern-kata`**: a Go program that runs in a Pane. It talks to kata's daemon and draws the Issue list and detail with Tern's own widgets, using the Tern Surface Protocol. Run outside Tern, it falls back to `kata tui`.
- **Window plugin** (`window.luau`): adds **Open kata** to the palette and binds `F9`. Both open `tern-kata` in a split on the right, in the focused Pane's directory. It also opens kata links: `kata://<project>/<id>` or `https://kata.invalid/<project>/<id>` focuses the running kata Pane (or opens one) and selects that Issue.

In a directory bound with `kata init`, `tern-kata` opens that Project's Issues. Anywhere else it opens Inbox beside the Menu sidebar, where you can switch to another view (Today, All Open, Logbook and others), browse your kata Projects or create a new one. In a bound directory the same Menu opens as a popup with `esc`, and `P` opens it straight at the list of Projects. Press `?` for the keybindings.

## Clickable ticket links from agents

Tern draws `kata://` links in chat as plain text, so agents should write ticket references as `https://kata.invalid/...` links, which the plugin intercepts. To make OMP do that in every kata-tracked repo, add this to `~/.omp/agent/RULES.md` (or to one repo's `AGENTS.md`):

```markdown
In a repo with a `.kata.toml`, write kata ticket references in chat replies as `[<id>](https://kata.invalid/<project>/<id>)`, with `<project>` the name in `.kata.toml`. The tern-kata window plugin opens them in tern-kata; Tern draws `kata://` links in chat as plain text. Everywhere else (files, commit messages, kata Issue text) write the bare id; those links only work inside Tern.
```

## Install

Requires Go 1.27+, kata v0.18.0+ and a Tern that supports the Surface Protocol.

1. On the **session host** (the machine whose shells run in your Panes), install kata, then:

   ```sh
   CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/Dangerboi/tern-kata/cmd/tern-kata@latest
   ```

   `tern-kata` must be on your shell's `PATH` (Go puts it in `~/go/bin`, or `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` on Windows). `tern-kata --version` prints the installed version.

2. On the **machine showing the Tern window**, install the window plugin:

   ```sh
   tern plugin install github.com/Dangerboi/tern-kata
   ```

The session host can run Linux, macOS or Windows. If it is the same machine as the window, you can do both steps on that one machine.

## Development

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o tern-kata ./cmd/tern-kata
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...
./smoke/run.sh      # end-to-end against a headless Tern and a throwaway kata daemon
tern plugin link .  # use this checkout as the window plugin
tern plugin reload  # exits 1 if a plugin fails to load; window failures show only as a toast
```

Releases: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml` (vet, test, then publish). Check it locally before tagging:

```sh
scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z   # writes dist/ (gitignored); fails unless plugin.toml's version is X.Y.Z; publishes nothing
```

It builds `tern-kata_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (`.zip` for `windows`) for `linux`, `darwin` and `windows` on `amd64` and `arm64`, plus `checksums.txt` in `sha256sum` format.

A release build sets the version with `-ldflags "-X main.version=vX.Y.Z"`. Without it, `tern-kata --version` reports the Go module version (`go install …@vX.Y.Z`), or `dev` for an untagged build.

`window.luau` is `--!strict`. To type-check it against the installed Tern's API (needs [luau-lsp](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp)):

```sh
tern plugin types .  # writes tern.d.luau (gitignored; regenerate per Tern version)
luau-lsp analyze --platform=standard --definitions=@tern=tern.d.luau --ignore=tern.d.luau window.luau
```
